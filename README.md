# Simulink Models for the creation of a Digital Twin

This repository provides the Simulink models used in conjuction with CARLA 
and ROS Bridge to run the experimental validation described in 
"Development of an Application Framework for Digital Twin-Driven Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles" 
doctoral dissertation by Nikolaos M. Sarantinoudis. 

In order to use these Simulink models in order to recreate the experimetns describes in the 
aforementioned dissertation, the following requirements have to be met: 

| Tool   | Version |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Host System  | Ubutnu 20.04 |
| MATALB | R2023b  |
| CARLA  | 0.9.13  |
| ROS2  | Foxy Fitzroy  |
